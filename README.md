# My ChatGPT tools

These are some of growing set of personal tools and experiments around ChatGPT.
This is primarily for my own use, and sparetime quick and dirty quality,
so don't expect anything to be stable or even work, and various things are in German.
But perhaps something is of use for you. If you'd like to know what I'm currently professionally doing with ChatGPT,
[this](https://github.com/ist-dresden/composum-chatgpt-integration) might be more interesting for you.

If you find something interesting, please [contact me](http://www.stoerr.net/)!
You will also find various ChatGPT related things on [my Blog](http://www.stoerr.net/blog.html).
