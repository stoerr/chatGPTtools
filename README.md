# My ChatGPT tools

These are some of growing set of tools and experiments around ChatGPT.
I started writing this for my own use in my sparetime and am extending it whenever I need something,
but most of that is already pretty stable, so you are welcome to use them, too!
I'll mark things that are new and thus unstable.
As far as the tools are web-based, they are deployed at the
[Github site](https://chatGPTtools.stoerr.net/) of this project.

https://chatGPTtools.stoerr.net/chatgpttools/0README.html
If you'd like to know what I'm professionally doing with ChatGPT,
[this](https://github.com/ist-dresden/composum-chatgpt-integration) might be more interesting for you.

If you find something interesting, please [contact me](http://www.stoerr.net/)!
You will also find many ChatGPT related things on [my Blog](http://www.stoerr.net/blog.html) , and there is also my
[Developers Tool Bench](https://github.com/stoerr/DevelopersChatGPTToolBench) which I'm growing.

Disclaimer: You know how it is - this is one of my sparetime projects and you're not paying me for that, so no
warranties. But please do send me bug reports and suggestions.

I'm happy if you use it, I'm even happier if you tell me about your experiences and maybe some successful
prompts or prompt fragments you used, and I'll jump up and down with joy if you link to my project or post about it
somewhere. :-)

By the way: if you like to use AI for software development, you might like some of my other
[ai tools](https://www.stoerr.net/ai) like the
[Co-Developer GPT engine](https://codevelopergptengine.stoerr.net/), with which you let ChatGPT look at your local
projects and help you with your coding, including modifing your code and run and fix builds, or the
[AI based code generation pipeline](https://aigenpipeline.stoerr.net/) - a command line tool that can support you in
systematically using AI to generate code / documentation during software development.

## What's here

- [bin/](bin/) contains a number of scripts around ChatGPT that help me in my daily work and might be interesting for
  you. See below (script list). Mostly for accessing various OpenAI APIs, but can sometimes also be used for
  compatible APIs.
- [public/](docs/chatgpttools/) contains some pages that I often use to access ChatGPT quickly - the [chat.openai.com]
  (https://chat.openai.com/) interface is a bit annoying at times. See [public/0README.html].
- [docs/](docs/) has stuff that is available at https://chatGPTtools.stoerr.net/ - see below.
- [templates/](templates/) some templates for use with [bin/chatgptapplytemplate](bin/chatgptapplytemplate) -
  basically an extended prompt with examples for ChatGPT to do something given a file.
- [personal/] contains an experiment to create a quick chat interface that supplies ChatGPT with a kind of long term
  memory.
- [ChatGPTTricks.md](ChatGPTTricks.md) contains a growing number of tipps and tricks around using ChatGPT and Github
  Copilot as a software developer etc. I intend to collect there much of the ChatGPT section in [my blog]
  (http://www.stoerr.net/blog.html), in short form.

## Bookmarklets deployed at https://chatGPTtools.stoerr.net/

- The ChatGPT Bookmarklet lets you summarize any webpage using ChatGPT, ask questions and more.
- The Grab Styles Bookmarklet lets you select an element from a page and extract it's HTML and applying CSS rules,
- e.g. to ask ChatGPT questions about it.
- There is also a [Dictation App](https://chatGPTtools.stoerr.net/dictation/index.html) that uses the OpenAI whisper
  API to transcribe your speech into a textarea.

## Script list in bin/

There is a couple of scripts in bin/ which you might like. The main script is chatgpt , which allows to access
ChatGPT chat completion API from the command line in various ways; the other scripts usually use that for the AI
functions. Here is a list of the scripts, of course generated by ChatGPT through
[project-bin/_makescriptlist](project-bin/_makescriptlist) using
[AI Code Generation Pipeline](https://aigenpipeline.stoerr.net/)
:-)

## Compatibility of `chatgpt` with other systems than OpenAI API

Since the main `chatgpt` script uses the OpenAI API and many LLM applications / providers provide a compatible API,
it can also be used to access other models. Try `chatgpt` with the following arguments:

- local model runners like [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) or [ollama](https://ollama.com/) : just use the -api
  argument, e.g. `-api http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions` for LM Studio.
- Google Gemini offers an additional [OpenAI compatible API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai) : e.g.
  `-api https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/chat/completions -rh "Authorization=Bearer $GEMINI_API_KEY" -m gemini-2.0-flash-lite`
- Anthropic Claude offers a [OpenAI compatibility endpoint](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/openai-sdk) as well:
  `chatgpt -api https://api.anthropic.com/v1/chat/completions -rh "Authorization=Bearer $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" -m claudegpt-3-7-sonnet-20250219`

[Anthropic Claude API](https://www.anthropic.com/api) also does it's own thing - I started a `[claudegpt](bin/claudegpt)`
script with a few features.
