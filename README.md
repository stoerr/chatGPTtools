# My ChatGPT tools

These are some of growing set of personal tools and experiments around ChatGPT.
This is primarily for my own use, and sparetime quick and dirty quality,
so don't expect anything to be stable or even work, and various things are in German.
But perhaps something is of use for you. If you'd like to know what I'm currently professionally doing with ChatGPT,
[this](https://github.com/ist-dresden/composum-chatgpt-integration) might be more interesting for you.

If you find something interesting, please [contact me](http://www.stoerr.net/)!
You will also find various ChatGPT related things on [my Blog](http://www.stoerr.net/blog.html).

## What's here

- [ChatGPTTricks.md](ChatGPTTricks.md) contains a growing number of tipps and tricks around using ChatGPT and Github
  Copilot as a software developer etc. I intend to collect there much of the ChatGPT section in [my blog]
  (http://www.stoerr.net/blog.html), in short form.
- [bin/](bin/) contains a number of scripts around ChatGPT that help me in my daily work and might be interesting for
  you. See below (script list)
- [public/](public/) contains some pages that I often use to access ChatGPT quickly - the [chat.openai.com]
  (https://chat.openai.com/) interface is a bit annoying at times. See [public/0README.html].
- [templates/](templates/) some templates for use with [bin/chatgptapplytemplate](bin/chatgptapplytemplate) -
  basically an extended prompt with examples for ChatGPT to do something given a file.
- [personal/] contains an experiment to create a quick chat interface that supplies ChatGPT with a kind of long term
  memory.
- [docs/](docs/) has stuff that will be available at https://stoerr.github.io/chatGPTtools/ , nothing really useable
  yet.

## Bookmarklets deployed at https://stoerr.github.io/chatGPTtools/

- The ChatGPT Bookmarklet lets you summarize any webpage using ChatGPT, ask questions and more.
- The Grab Styles Bookmarklet lets you select an element from a page and extract it's HTML and applying CSS rules,
- e.g. to ask ChatGPT questions about it.

## Script list in bin/

There is a couple of scripts in bin/ which you might like. The main script is chatgpt , which allows to access
ChatGPT chat completion API from the command line in various ways; the other scripts usually use that for the AI
functions. Here is a list of the scripts, of course generated by ChatGPT through
[project-bin/_makescriptlist](project-bin/_makescriptlist) :-)

<!-- Start scriptlist -->

- `chatgpt`: submits a prompt to ChatGPT conversation and prints the response to stdout
- `chatgptapplytemplate`: applies a ChatGPT chat template to a file and prints the result to stdout
- `chatgptsummarizeurl`: fetches the content of a URL and sends a request to summarize the content to ChatGPT
- `createJavaUnittest`: generates a JUnit 4 test for a given Java file
- `suggestbash`: sends a task description to ChatGPT, which returns a bash command line for the given task and prints it
- `suggestfish`: sends a task description to ChatGPT, which returns a fish command line for the given task and prints it
- `chatgptsearchscript`: searches this toolbox for a suitable ChatGPT related command line utility to perform a task
  described in the command line
