# Please generate a script for the command line for the following task, runnable on a MacBook Pro with Apple M1 Max, that is, arm64 architecture, and MacOS Ventura 13.3.1 . It can be either a bash script using any of the normally present MacOS command line tools or what is installable with homebrew, or a NodeJS script for version 19.5.0 . If NodeJS, it should not require installing any additional libraries. If called without arguments or with the argument
# --help, the script should describe it's usage and exit - including what options and arguments it expects, and (important!) a short description what it does.

# The name of the script is chatgptsearchscript. If the option --help wasn't given, it should collect all command line arguments into the variable prompt. Then it should take the file _usages.txt in the directory containing the script, pipe that into the program chatgpt with the arguments
# chatgpt - $additionalprompt $prompt
