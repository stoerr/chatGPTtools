# This script was generated using ChatGPT with the following prompt, and then manually edited slightly:
# Please generate a script for the command line for the following task, runnable on a MacBook Pro with Apple M1 Max, that is, arm64 architecture, and MacOS Ventura 13.3.1 . It can be either a bash script using any of the normally present MacOS command line tools or what is installable with homebrew, or a NodeJS script for version 19.5.0 . If NodeJS, it should not require installing any additional libraries. If called without arguments or with the argument
# --help, the script should describe it's usage and exit - including what options and arguments it expects, and (important!) a short description what it does.

# The name of the script is _makeusagetxt. There are no command line arguments or options except --help. It should check whether there is a file name _usages.txt in the directory it is in, and if there are any executable files in the current directory that do have a name not starting with _ and are newer than _usages.txt. If _usages.txt is not there or not newer, it should execute all those executable files with the argument --help and collect the output into _usages.txt . Each output should be prefixed with
# (name of that executable file)
