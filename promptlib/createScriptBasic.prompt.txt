DESCRIPTION=basic instructions for generating scripts

Please generate a script for the command line for the following task, runnable on a MacBook Pro with Apple M1 Max, that is, arm64 architecture, and MacOS Ventura 13.3.1 .
It can be either a bash script using any of the normally present MacOS command line tools or what is installable with homebrew, or a NodeJS script for version 19.5.0 .
If NodeJS, it should not require installing any additional libraries. If called without arguments or with the argument --help,
the script should describe it's usage and exit - including what options and arguments it expects, and
(important!) a short description what it does. For a bash script, parse the options with getopt.
