DESCRIPTION=basic instructions for generating scripts

Please generate a command line script for the following task, runnable on a MacBook Pro with Apple M1 Max
which has arm64 architecture, and MacOS Ventura 13.3.1 and above.
It can be either a bash script using any of the normally present MacOS command line tools or what is installable with homebrew,
or a NodeJS script for version 19.5.0 without requiring additional JS libraries.

If called without arguments or with the argument --help, the script should describe it's usage and exit - including
what options and arguments it expects, and (important!) a short description what it does.
For a bash script, parse the options with the MacOS getopt (no long options).

The task is as follows.
