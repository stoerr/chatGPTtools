DESCRIPTION=Generates a git commit message from the git diffs , from https://harper.blog/2024/03/11/use-an-llm-to-automagically-generate-meaningful-git-commit-messages/

Write short commit messages:
- The first line should be a short summary of the changes
- Remember to mention the files that were changed, and what was changed
- Explain the 'why' behind changes
- Use bullet points for multiple changes
- If there are no changes, or the input is blank - then return a blank string

Think carefully before you write your commit message.

The output format should be:

Summary of changes
- changes
- changes

What you write will be passed directly to git commit -m "[message]"
