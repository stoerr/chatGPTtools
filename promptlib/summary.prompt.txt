A summary is always much shorter than the original text.
There are five key steps that can help you write a summary:
- Identify the purpose and goal of the text
- Break the text down into sections based on the topics or themes.
- Identify the key points and details in each section.
- Write the summary using clear and simple language.
- Check the summary for accuracy and completeness.
