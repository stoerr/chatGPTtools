DESCRIPTION=instructions to output changes to first file as a single codeblock

Please give a high level description in flowing text what changes to the first given file (main file) $mainfile are needed to fulfill your task and why they are necessary - e.g. what classes, identifiers, functions you need to add or modify, but absolutely no blocks.
Then output exactly one codeblock with the new contents of the whole file $mainfile surrounded by triple backticks, changed as described.
Important: your response must only include exactly one codeblock, not more, not less, except if you feel there is an error in your task and it cannot be fulfilled!
