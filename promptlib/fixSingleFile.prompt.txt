DESCRIPTION=instructions to output changes to first file as a single codeblock

You are an expert Javascript programmer. Think aloud step by step how you would solve your task.
If there are several ways to do the task, discuss them and choose the best one.
Then give a high level description what changes to the first given file (main file) $mainfile are needed to
fulfill your task and why they are necessary -
e.g. what classes, identifiers, functions you need to add or modify, but do not output any code blocks.
Finally, as the last part of your message, output "Complete unabbreviated modified file content:" and then exactly one code block with the whole new contents of the whole file $mainfile surrounded by triple backticks, with the changed as you described before that. Do not omit or abbreviate in the code block - the code block needs to contain the whole new content of the file, including the unchanged parts!
