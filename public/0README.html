A simple HTML page that explains shortly:
 - this is my personal experimental space for ChatGPT. So don't expect anything to work, or to be stable.
 - But you're welcome to have fun with it, and I even more welcome feedback and fresh ideas for improvements. Contact me at http://www.stoerr.net/contact.html .
 - You'll need your own ChatGPT API key to run that, which you can get at https://platform.openai.com/ .
