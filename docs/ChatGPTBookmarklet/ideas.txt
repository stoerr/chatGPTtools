- configure alternative backends
    - permanently for certain pages
    - location: local storage
    - visibly show used backend

# Deprecated / perhaps

- Chrome plugin?

- thinking spinner

- use an iframe instead? -> iframe cannot access parent document directly - communication via postMessage . But it could store settings and api key in local storage!

- scroll the answer if too long (didn't work, no idea why.)
- Use ChatGPT webapp as backend

====== Configurability ======

There should be a configuration dialog with a description and a text field where one can input JSON.
It should be shown when a configuration button with the "wrench" symbol is clicked.
The configuration is stored in local storage with the key "net.stoerr.chatgptbookmarklet.config".

====== Spec for alternative backends ======

There should be a dropdown list "backend" that is shown if there are more than one backend configured.
If that's changed then the list of models should be updated according to what list models returns for the selected backend.

There can also be an 'autoselect' option that selects the backend automatically based on the URL of the current page.
It contains a regular expression that is matched against the URL of the current page.
First backend that matches the URL is selected, otherwise the first backend in the list is selected.

The configuration contains per backend:
    - name (e.g. "OpenAI", "Anthropic", "Mistral"),
    - base URL (in case of OpenAI https://api.openai.com/v1)
    - list of objects with authentication header name (in case of Open AI "Authorization") and value ("Authorization Bearer <api key>")
for example:
```json
{
    "backends": [
        {
            "name": "OpenAI",
            "baseUrl": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
            "authHeaders": [
                {
                    "name": "Authorization",
                    "value": "Bearer <api key>"
                }
            ],
            "defaultModel": "gpt-4.1",
        },
        {
            "name": "Anthropic",
            "baseUrl": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1",
            "authHeaders": [
                {
                    "name": "Authorization",
                    "value": "Bearer <api key>"
                }
            ],
            "defaultModel": "gpt-4.1",
            "autoSelect": ".*intranet.*"
        }
    ]
}
```
