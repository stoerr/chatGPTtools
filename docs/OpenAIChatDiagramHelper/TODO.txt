# Things to solve here:

- export more CSS rules heuristically: e.g. that apply to classes present in the element and descendants, as a new modus
- delete CSS variables that aren't used in any of the rules
- export media rules that do currently apply.
- options what to export?
- make it work with frames if possible.
