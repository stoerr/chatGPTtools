                        This is part of my personal playground with ChatGPT. These are toys but work, and
                        you're welcome to have fun with it, and I even more welcome feedback and fresh ideas for
                        improvements.
                        Contact me <a href="http://www.stoerr.net/contact.html">here</a>.
                        The sources for these are in my
                        <a href="https://github.com/stoerr/chatGPTtools">chatGPTtools</a>
                        project.

                    <p>
                        Usage: when editing in textareas, you can often submit with enter, and insert a newline with
                        shift+enter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You'll need your own ChatGPT API key to run that, which you can get at <a
                            href="//platform.openai.com/">https://platform.openai.com/</a>.
                        After logging in there with your ChatGPT credentials, you can create an API key in the
                        profile settings (top right corner) at "View API keys".

                            Ask a single question to ChatGPT without actually having a chat. This is often much quicker
                            than a full chat session.
