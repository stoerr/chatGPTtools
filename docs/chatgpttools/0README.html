                        This is part of my ChatGPT / OpenAI toolsuite.
                        These are small applications ranging from toys to workhorses, and
                        you're welcome to have fun with it, and I even more welcome feedback and fresh ideas for
                        improvements.
                        Contact me <a href="http://www.stoerr.net/contact.html">here</a>.
                        The sources for these are in my
                        <a href="https://github.com/stoerr/chatGPTtools">chatGPTtools</a>

                        of the tools.

                    <h4>Usage hints for chat simulation / chat template debugger for the OpenAI chat completion API</h4>
                    <p>
                        When editing in textareas, you can often submit with enter, and insert a newline with
                        shift+enter. Hover over the buttons / input fields to see tooltips with more information.
                        The import / export field admits either complete JSON requests for the chat completion API, or
                        just the list of messages. By setting "n" to a higher value you can check out the range of
                        answers you'd get from the API in one go. "Retry" will remove the last answer(s) and try again.
                        There are a number of system prompts to select, though most of them are mostly for fun.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You'll need your own ChatGPT API key to run that, which you can get at <a
                            href="//platform.openai.com/">https://platform.openai.com/</a>.
                        After logging in there with your ChatGPT credentials, you can create an API key in the
                        profile settings (top right corner) at "View API keys".

                            A testbed for executing chats with several messages. It provides various options for
                            simulating a chat with multiple messages between the user, the system, and the assistant,
                            as well as importing and exporting requests to the OpenAI chat completion API for debugging.

                            A tool that uses the OpenAI Whisper API to transcribe spoken words into text, and
                            then corrects any transcription errors, corrects grammar and spelling, and formats the
                            text.

                            Ask a single question to ChatGPT without actually having a chat. This is often much quicker
                            than a full chat session.
