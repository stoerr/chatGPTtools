Print on line short description what the script does.
Do not mention the options and arguments, since these are described in the script itself.
Sort the scripts alphabetically by their name.
Do not mention ChatGPT in the description, since almost all scripts use ChatGPT to perform their function,
so this would add no information. Rather explain what the script does, without mentioning ChatGPT.
Print only one line with a short description, no additional text, no bullet points, no list.
